# Machine-Learning-to-classify-IMBD-critics
Machine Learning project to classify text critics from IMBD, with binary and multi-class classification
---

#### This practical work is based on solving a set of tasks, associated with a database with texts from IMBD movie reviews. The sklearn library was used.

* For this practical work the data contains 40,000 text documents, rated with a score on a scale
from one to ten, where neutral reviews, with scores of 5 and 6, were excluded.
* To be able to perform machine learning techniques such as classification and clustering on text data, it is
necessary to represent each document by a numerical vector, for this the Bag of Words model and the
tf-idf method were used.
* Based on the text documents, three main tasks were carried out, respectively:
  1. Determine whether the criticism is positive or negative (binary classification process).
  2. Predict the score of the critique, in a value between 1-4 and 7-10 (multi-class classification process).
  3. Find through common words between different texts, groups of documents that address similar areas or themes (clustering
  similar areas or themes (clustering process).
